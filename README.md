# arm-mips-tools
Useful executables (statically linked via musl libc) for different variants of ARM and MIPS Linux systems (MSB, LSB, different ABIs, etc.) meant for doing low-level work on embedded devices

## Intro

I recently needed a statically linked gdbserver for all of the above platforms, as well as some subtle variants- even MIPS-I and ARM with the "old" ABI! It was a little bit painful to build all of them, so I figured I would share them. Please, if you find them useful, take them. They are built from vanilla GDB 7.7.1 sources, with a small tweak to the final linking to get a static build. There was also some hackery required in some cases for unknown reasons, possibly bugs with gdb, to fix up missing #define values and such. Also, when compiling on native architectures, in many cases I had to make sure the GDB build process didn't try to include thread support since there aren't any common packages (I've noticed) that have static libraries for libthread_db and the configure script will enable libthread_db if it detects it on your system

This repository has expanded to include more than gdbserver obviously, but most of the notes here are about gdbserver.

Being added slowly for different CPU instruction sets, endianness, revisions and ABIs:

*libpcap (static library)
*tcpdump (statically linked)
*gawk (statically linked)
*lsof (statically linked)
*gdbserv (statically linked)
*tshd (statically linked)

These tools are all of obvious value on embedded devices, except mayhe gawk. Why gawk?

```
$ while [ 1 ];
> do
> /usr/sbin/process/that/forks/and/detaches; sleep 1;./gdbs --attach :12345 $(ps w | grep detache[s] | awk '{print $1}')
> done
```

This is a lot easier than checking the PID after manually restarting the process each time (assuming it is crashing a lot, and it is being analyzed upon each crash remotely.will save a TON of time


## Notes

* Some are linked with glibc or uClibc- this is a problem, moreso for some than others. They are slowly all being built with musl libc to get rid of all the issues with nsswitch.conf libraries.
* There will always be issues with gdbserver needing support for dlopen()/dlsym() but I haven't come across a case where it was actually needed/used, nor have I encountered a crash
* There is no threading support in gdbserver right now, intentionally
* Yes, you have to just trust me on these being 'safe' otherwise you can go build your own :>

## More detailed information on the build targets

I didn't keep very good documentation as a built all of these, I can't even tell you for sure which --target parameter I used. I tried to name each binary intuitively and as correctly as I could but here is a quick summary of each based on output from file(1)

```
gdbserver-7.7.1-armel:              ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.4.3
gdbserver-7.7.1-armel-eabi5-sysv:   ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.26
gdbserver-7.7.1-armhf-eabi5-sysv:   ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.26
gdbserver-7.7.1-mipsel-mips32:      ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked
gdbserver-7.7.1-mipsel-ii:          ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1, statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.26
gdbserver-7.7.1-mips-ii:            ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1, statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.26
gdbserver-7.7.1-mips-mips32:        ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1, statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.26
gdbserver-7.7.1-mips-i:             ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
gdbserver-6.8-mips-i-rtl819x-lexra: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped

```

These are not stripped, go ahead and strip them if you want. And once more, there are now many more than just gdbserver executables in this repository, explore the directory tree

Note the special rtl819x-lexra build. This is a build specific to rtl819x SoC with Lexra CPU. Lexra CPUs are a MIPS-I with some instructions not implemented (unaligned loads, stores, shifts)

Thanks to https://github.com/KrabbyPatty/rtl819x-toolchain for making a toolchain available to build this. I was unable to get gdb 7.7.1 to build, so it is version 6.8.

## Other targets

If you'd like another target architecture, either file an issue or send a pull request, I'd be happy to have a wider collection of these as I do a fair amount of work on embedded devices and seem to always be coming across ones that I don't already have a build for

## General tips on performing a static build of GDB 7.7.1

If you're all properly set up with a toolchain, for example the Broadcom toolchain, this might be all you need for GDB:


```
$ tar -xzf gdb-7.7.1.tgz
$ cd gdb-7.7.1/gdb/gdbserver
$ ./configure --host=mipsel-linux-uclibc --disable-werror CFLAGS='-isysroot /opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-linux/'
$ make -j
$ rm -f gdbserver
$ V=1 make
... modify the final build command as below with libdl and -static ...
```

There is no supported what that I have found to to a static build of GDB 7.7.1. So I have my own routine. It is roughly like this:

```
$ export TARGET=mipsel-unknown-linux-uclibc
$ tar xzf gdb-7.7.1.tar.gz
$ cd gdb-7.7.1/gdb/gdbserver
$ ./configure --host=$TARGET
$ make -j
... usually, something superficial fails, like some #define is missing, etc ...
$ find ~/ -name \*.h -exec grep -Hn SOME_DEFINE {} \;
bah.h: #define SOME_DEFINE 12345
... add the #define into the source file that was complaining ...
$ make -j
... build is successful ...
$ rm gdbserver
$ V=1 make
... observer the final command to link gdbserver and copy it into your terminal ...
... remove the -ldl at the end and replace it with the path to libdl.a for the target architecture ...
... add -static as a flag and run the command ...
... see example below ...
$ ls gdbserver
... you have gdbserver, huzzah ...
```

### Example of fixing the final gcc command 

When you do rm gdbserver; V=1 make, here is an example of the before and after command:

#### Before

```
mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc -g -O2    -I. -I. -I./../common -I./../regformats -I./.. -I./../../include -I./../gnulib/import -Ibuild-gnulib-gdbserver/import -Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wpointer-arith -Wformat-nonliteral -Wno-char-subscripts -Werror -DGDBSERVER  -rdynamic -o gdbserver agent.o ax.o inferiors.o regcache.o remote-utils.o server.o signals.o target.o waitstatus.o utils.o version.o vec.o gdb_vecs.o mem-break.o hostio.o event-loop.o tracepoint.o xml-utils.o common-utils.o ptid.o buffer.o format.o filestuff.o dll.o notif.o tdesc.o xml-builtin.o mips-linux.o mips-dsp-linux.o mips64-linux.o mips64-dsp-linux.o linux-low.o linux-osdata.o linux-procfs.o linux-ptrace.o linux-waitpid.o linux-mips-low.o mips-linux-watch.o hostio-errno.o thread-db.o proc-service.o build-gnulib-gdbserver/import/libgnu.a -ldl
```

#### After

```
mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc -g -O2    -I. -I. -I./../common -I./../regformats -I./.. -I./../../include -I./../gnulib/import -Ibuild-gnulib-gdbserver/import -Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wpointer-arith -Wformat-nonliteral -Wno-char-subscripts -Werror -DGDBSERVER  -rdynamic -o gdbserver agent.o ax.o inferiors.o regcache.o remote-utils.o server.o signals.o target.o waitstatus.o utils.o version.o vec.o gdb_vecs.o mem-break.o hostio.o event-loop.o tracepoint.o xml-utils.o common-utils.o ptid.o buffer.o format.o filestuff.o dll.o notif.o tdesc.o xml-builtin.o mips-linux.o mips-dsp-linux.o mips64-linux.o mips64-dsp-linux.o linux-low.o linux-osdata.o linux-procfs.o linux-ptrace.o linux-waitpid.o linux-mips-low.o mips-linux-watch.o hostio-errno.o thread-db.o proc-service.o build-gnulib-gdbserver/import/libgnu.a /projects/hnd/tools/linux/hndtools-mipsel-linux-uclibc-4.2.3/lib/libdl.a -static
```

As stated above, the only difference is the '-ldl' has been swapped out with /projects/hnd/tools/linux/hndtools-mipsel-linux-uclibc-4.2.3/lib/libdl.a and the -static option has been added

### Building on a native MIPS Linux qemu image

I noticed that when using an actual MIPS archtecture OS to perform this build, I ran into issues with libthread_db when trying to statically link. Debian does not include a copy of this library and none of the options that seemed like they were supposed to disable threading worked. So my workaround was to "hide" the libthread_db related files before running the configure command. You can do this easily with find

WARNING: THIS IS A DANGEROUS COMMAND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! IT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY A BETTER IDEA TO PATCH GDB CONFIGURE OR MAKEFILE FILES!

```
find / -name libthread_db\* -exec mv {} {}.bak \;
```
#### How do I know these binaries aren't backdoored?

They aren't. But you'll have to trust me on that unless you want to figure out how to build them yourself. It's not the most trivial thing to document and I don't really have the time if I wanted to
